        <h1>PAYDAY™ The Heist</h1>
        <p> In PAYDAY™ The Heist, players use a variety of firearms to complete objectives. The game plays from the first person perspective, but offers a few twists on the standard FPS formula. Killing civilians is punished, instead players may take a limited number as hostages. Should any player get arrested during the heist, one of their teammates may release a hostage, allowing a trade to take place which allows a single player to be released.

            <br> <br>
         The game focuses on four robbers (Dallas, Hoxton, Chains, and Wolf) who team up. Their first heist took place at the First World Bank, where they entered a vault by using thermite hidden on the inside of a photocopier and stole a large amount of money. A post-game message congratulates the group, telling them that they are "set for life", but recommends more heists, including robbing drug junkies in an abandoned apartment complex and ambushing a prisoner transport in heavy rain weather, simply for the enjoyment of the players.</p>
